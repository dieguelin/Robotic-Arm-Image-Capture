# Robotic-Arm-Image-Capture
This is the code for a 2 DOF robotic system that repositions a Raspberry Pi Camera using 2 DC motors controlled with a Raspberry Pi. The system takes pictures simulataneosly. The idea is to capture images of objects from different perspectives for photogrammetry or training object detection algorithms.
